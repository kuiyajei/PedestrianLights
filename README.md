This version covers what's intended BUT it'll need some testing.

### Issues:
- Green LED is on no matter what. I think it's just a circuit connection error on my end but please try it out yourself. And -- if you can -- fix the code if it's not a connection error.

### Nice to add:
- Simple tune when the switch is pushed. Maybe add a second beep? Make sure to make use of multitasking (millis) for this to function properly. Using delay will screw up the system.
- Refactor code to make it look more organized.
