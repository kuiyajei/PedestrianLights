Signal cycle is now functional but is not complete.

Minor issue(s):
- Caution does not blink at "0"
- Caution blinking is functional but the code may be inefficient. Maybe.

Major issue(s):
- Green LED is still on no matter what. I'm not sure if this is a hardware problem for me.

Still needs to be added:
-  Button to reduce timer.
- Buzzer noise when button is pressed.
